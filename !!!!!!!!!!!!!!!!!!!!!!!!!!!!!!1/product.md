add those to product
Yes — your structure is already solid, but if you want it to feel *production-grade* and cover more real-world e-commerce needs, you could enhance it with:

---

### **1. Marketing & Merchandising Fields**

* **`badges`** → Array of marketing labels (`["Bestseller", "Limited Stock"]`) for quick tagging in UI.
* **`seo`** → Title, meta description, keywords for search optimization.
* **`collections`** → Which collection(s) or campaigns this product belongs to.

---

### **2. Inventory & Logistics**

* **`barcode` / `gtin` / `upc`** → For warehouse & POS integration.
* **`warehouseLocation`** → Useful for fulfillment centers.
* **`leadTime`** → If it’s a preorder or needs manufacturing time.
* **`restockDate`** → If `inStock` is false but you know the next arrival.

---

### **3. Pricing Improvements**

* **`compareAtPrice`** instead of `originalPrice` (common naming in Shopify/Magento).
* **`priceTiers`** → For bulk discounts (`buy 3+, get 10% off`).
* **`currency` per variant** if selling in multiple regions.

---

### **4. Media**

* **`videos`** → Product demo or fashion runway videos.
* **`imagePriority`** → Mark which image is primary/thumbnail.
* **`360View` / `ARModel`** → If you want to support interactive viewing.

---

### **5. Variants Enhancements**

Right now, you have:

```json
{
  "sizes": [
    { "size": "S", "quantity": 4 }
  ]
}
```

I’d extend it:

```json
{
  "sizes": [
    { "size": "S", "quantity": 4, "sku": "NORTHCOAT-RED-S", "ean": "1234567890" }
  ]
}
```

That way, *each size-color combination* can be individually tracked.

---

### **6. Compliance & Policies**

* **`careInstructions`** → `"Dry clean only"`.
* **`countryOfOrigin`** → Required in some markets.
* **`warranty`** → If applicable.

---

### **7. Analytics & Tracking**

* **`views`** → Number of times viewed.
* **`conversionRate`** → Useful for A/B testing.
* **`lastPurchasedAt`** → For personalization.

---

If you want, I can **merge your current structure** with all these pro-level fields into a single *future-proof product schema* that still stays clean and readable.
That way, you’re covered for catalog, checkout, SEO, and even warehouse integration.
